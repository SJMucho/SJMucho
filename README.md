I'm currently working on an artist portfolio site for my talented friend Tracey McTague, and I'm about to start contributing to an exciting project called MBUYU. I'll be part of a team writing code in an effort to digitize data and records for the country of Burundi.

Check out my music site, I built it but it's still a work in progress: www.sarahmuchomusic.com
